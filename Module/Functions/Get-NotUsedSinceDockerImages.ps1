    .SYNOPSIS
        PowerShell script for invoking rest api call to jfrog artifactory to get the list of docker images, that has not been used for amount of days.

    .DESCRIPTION
        
        
    .INPUTS
        -Repository <string[]>

        -NotUsedSinceInDays <int[]>

    .OUTPUTS
        Information about download statistics for the docker images.
        Docker image layers are stored as separate artifacts within an "image" folder. 
        If a layer is already in most Docker clients, it wonâ€™t get downloaded often. 
        So search based on the "manifest.json" file, which is what will be changed only when that specific image/tag are downloaded/used. 
        If a layer is shared between two different tags and if one of the tag is a candidate for the delete in your case above, then the layer will NOT be deleted in the binary storage since it will be still referenced by the other tag.
